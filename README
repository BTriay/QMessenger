QMessenger

This code is based on my work done for my project of the master Computing & Information Systems at Queen Mary University, London.

This is a complete instant messenger software, with a Linux server and cross-platform client. It uses sqlite for cold storage. The client interface was developped in Qt Creator.

No installation is required for the server, simply launch it and it will automatically create its own database and become a daemon. Use the makefile to compile it on distribution (Linux only: the code uses the epoll() function).
Use Qt Creator to compile the client on Linux or Windows. This should be portable to OS X: you will need to include the correct header definition & library #include in the ConnectionWindow.h and parser.h files, so that the htons() and ntohs() function are declared.

Folders are organized as:
./client/QMessenger
./server
./sqlite-amalgamation
	Get the files to put in this last folder from the sqlite official website:
	https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
	sqlite-amalgamation-3140100.zip
